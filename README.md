# Sudoku Group Project

This project emulates the production of a genetic software system.
The purpose of this assignment was to create a software application
that solves a puzzle game similar to Sudoku using genetic algorithms. 

For more information on the task at hand, see `assignment-task.md`.

## How do I get started?

The implementation of this project was done using Windows Forms is
which is Windows-native. This means that this project is not compatible
with Unix-based systems, such as Linux or Mac.

To understand the program and how it runs, see the `/.pseudocode/` file
in the `/doc/` folder for the pseudo code implementation.

To run the program on your Windows machine, select `PuzzleSolver.zip`
from the `/bin/` folder and unzip.

Once you've downloaded the program, run the `.exe` file.

The program will run as a small console-based application. Click
the `Solve` button to solve the problem.
